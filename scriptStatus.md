Idea: WHY have the arc install item in each section with seperate functions? ... I should make ONE function that takes care of things no matter the distro and in each Distro Section .... link to that single function

All Tasks means most of the above tasks just done all at once and not forcing the user to click one by one by one.  IMPORTANT ... put a prompt to the user at the start with "are you SURE you want to do this?"
