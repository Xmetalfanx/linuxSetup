What needs to be tested for the intial gitDownload to "pass" and a sync to master?

- Etcher - Works on 22.04 - remove debugging code
- mediaElch - its still in the Downloads folder ... i need to say move this to ~/Programs and ... what happened to the "add it to the menu" step?
- Atom - WOrks on Neon 22.04
- Stacer - works on Neon 22.04
- Strawberry - DEB using the PPA (probably a good idea since the dev recommends it i guess) - doesn't install ? (tested on Neon 22.04)


## I have decided to retest what i have above

- Atom - gets correct URL for openSUSE (RPM link), totally ok on openSUSE
 and works fine on Neon 

- Etcher - gets correct URL for openSUSE (appImage), downloads and gets marked as executable ok, but no menu entry added, doesn't get moved to ~/Programs (stays in ~/Downloads)
NEON install deb fine 


- mediaElch - gets correct URL for openSUSE, same with Neon 

- Stacer - gets correct URL for openSUSE (AppImage), gets and install the DEB on Neon 

- Strawberry - fails/loops on OpenSUSE ,
