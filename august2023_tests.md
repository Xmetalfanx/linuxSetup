# Mint Theme redo Check

| --------------------------------- | ---- | ------ | ------ | -------- | ----- | ------ |
| compiled theme - Mint-y (offical) | Pass |        |        | Pass     |       |        |
| compiled theme - Mint-Yz          | Pass |        |        |          |       |        |
| extracted icons - mint-y          | Pass |        |        | Pass     |       |        |

- possible todo: I may have to do a better job clearing vars ... after i installed mint-y, but without exiting scripts, mintYz's wouldn't download ... quiting scripts (no change), running it again downloaded mint-yz's repo as expected
