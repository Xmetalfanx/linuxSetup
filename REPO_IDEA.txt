when the internet comes back, consider cherry picking commits (and removing from "gitDownloadTrial")

commits 
    - Updated Message about test results
    - Added defaultFileFormat ... 
    - Var Name Fix 
    - ???? (maybe not this one) - Simplified Bleachbit code 
    - (this one may result in merge conflicts, if moved down now) Simplifying TinyMediaManager Code
