# Test

## Tests before next sync to mater

| Action            | Arch | Debian | Fedora | OpenSUSE | Solus | Ubuntu    |
| ----------------- | ---- | ------ | ------ | -------- | ----- | --------- |
| Custom Menus      |      |        |        |          |       | TMM works |
| Fix for yay error | Done | N/A    | N/A    | N/A      | N/A   | N/A       |

- I am not sure what happened but the way custom items are added + the way I had been adding menu entries got out of sorts ... this test means custom menus are added correctly again

- custom menus means for say downloaded appimages or tarballs to custom add them to the menus
