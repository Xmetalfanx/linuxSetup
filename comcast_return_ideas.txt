when the internet comes back, consider cherry picking commits (and removing from "gitDownloadTrial")

commits 
    - Updated Message about test results
    - Added defaultFileFormat ... 
    - Var Name Fix 
    - ???? (maybe not this one) - Simplified Bleachbit code 
    - (this one may result in merge conflicts, if moved down now) Simplifying TinyMediaManager Code

  releasePage="https://github.com/${repoName}/releases/latest" is the same so ... is there a way to put this in MAYBE "gitDownload"'s function and NOT have it in every software function that will call "gitDownload" ... that is redundant code for no reason

mediaElch is a git AppImage dowload too it seems, so that needs to be refactored with the new gitDownload function

Etcher is too 

I think i am skipping wildcard/RE's in nameFormat var 

TODO: lookup (IF it even matters) if it's better to use case_example or caseExample with vars
