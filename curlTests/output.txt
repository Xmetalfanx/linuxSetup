# issues

- naming scheme ... some are "name_version_codename.fileformat", some are "name.fileformat" some have obsecure names (see SmartTubeNext's name), some are say "name_aritecture.fileformat" with no version

# goal: to download the correct file for a distro based on info provided by the "software function" while still keeping the "gitDownload" function in sort of a template format so anything can be passed.

- IF Debian or Ubuntu (or really RPM distros can be included here too)... detect if their is a codename 

   issue: say atom's DEB is the same DEB for "all" but Strawberry's are specific to distro versions 

- also i dont want a list to filter out stuff like "strawberry-debugging-foobar-amd64.rpm" ... if i search for "deb" the "deb" in debugging is triggering the filter.

- idea 
   look for the file format at the end of the line and possible use a "name_format" sort of var that is passed to the gitDownload... problem is i can use $version in that var SINCE at the point of the software function ... the version is not known
