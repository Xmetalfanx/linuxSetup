## Main Stable Tasks

- I am not assuming anything but in some cases it seems (XNViewMP I THINK is one of tt hem ... GitKraken appears to be another) the same DEBs can be used on Debian or Ubuntu ... HOWEVER ... until I know for each app below ... I will assume that is not the case and I know its not a good idea unless the app dev says it to be so.

- with Audio-Recorder on Debian ... the snap may be the only real options
