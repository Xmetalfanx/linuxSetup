* Codec install is for those that haven't selected "Install Codecs on install" I suppose
** I am skipping "Update System" here since if it works on the LTS base an ElementaryOS is based on, it should work here no problem

N/A = Not Applicable

Testing these on all the Ubuntu flavors and variants (Linux Lite, ElementaryOS, ..etc) will be a problem for me... where it says "ubuntu" the test IS FOR Ubuntu
