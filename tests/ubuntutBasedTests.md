- listing TMM as a fail for now since java is NOT DETECTED but DOESN'T install ... issue is ... it's not that it doesn't work ... I just haven't code "install java" for Ubuntu base yet ... it's not done yet

- Strawberry (since there are DEBs for every Ubuntu and Debian branch vs "one for Debian" and "one for Ubuntu")... for now I have decided to use the AppImage for Ubuntu 19.10

Testing these on all the Ubuntu flavors and variants (Linux Lite, ElementaryOS, ..etc) will be a problem for me... where it says "ubuntu" the test IS FOR Ubuntu
