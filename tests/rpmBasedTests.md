- Third Party Repo Info

  - Fedora

    - Both RPM Fusion Repos

  - OpenSuse

    - Pacman Repos

\*\*\* I REFORMATTED the OpenSUSE 15.0 VM I had when 15.1 came out ... if something says pass on 15.1 and fail on 15.0, there is a good change that 15.0's code is fixed too, but I will not change the status until i know for sure

- TMM issue on Fedora - IT runs HOWEVER I already installed Java first ... double check (say Java is not instatlled by the standalone java support option ... that installing TMM would install Java first )

- Nov 2019 Update: this issue I noted may be solved with new Java install method for Fedora (untested at the time of typing this)

- MakeMKV not stopping to show the user the license info

#### Coding/Office/Productivity Programs

- Atom Devs are not signing the rpm (that is what the zypper warning is about)... no way of installing the RPM gets around this fact ... just hit I (ignore) at that step and it will install just fine

| Menu Item | Menu Task   |     | Fedora 29  | Fedora 30 | Fedora 31 |
| --------- | ----------- | --- | ---------- | --------- | --------- |
| 1         | Atom Editor |     | Fail\*     | Pass      |           |
| 2         | vscode      |     | Pass       | Pass      |           |
| 3         | Git Kraken  |     | Not Tested | Pass      |           |
| 4         | Typora      |     | Pass       | Pass      |           |

*Upgraded to Fedora 30 with a fresh install before I could test again

- Note: a Fail listed here is not going to be changed unless I know it works on that version ... if some things say fail and others pass, than the one that failed MAY be fixed too, but until i know for sure i will be honest and not change it since i have not seen the fix
