# Arch Tasks

## Main Arch Tasks

| Menu Tasks                                                |     | Arch | Manjaro    |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | --- | ---- | ---------- |
| Update System                                             |     | Pass | Not Tested |
| Install Codecs                                            |     | Pass | Not Tested |
| Add Sound Support (different from just installing codecs) |     | Pass | Not Tested |
| Add Archive Support                                       |     | Pass | Not Tested |

- The Archive Support fail is likely due to me reorganizing the menu

## Theming Menus

| Menu Items           |     | Arch      | Manjaro    |
| -------------------- | --- | --------- | ---------- |
| Install Adapta Theme |     | Pass      | Not Tested |
| Install Arc Theme    |     | Pass      | Not Tested |
| Install Mint-Y Theme |     | Not Coded | Not Tested |

| Install Misc Icons   |     | Pass      | Not Tested |
| All Listed Themes    |     | Pass      | Not Tested |

- if something is not coded yet, it's not failing, so i count "all themes (that ARE CODED) that work, as "all listed theming works"

I dont want to really include personal comments here but while I have played with different distros and different bases before .. I can never (on actual hardware) get Manjaro working long enough without annoying me so ... I will leave the "not tested" stuff up for Manjaro but I am not sure I can really ever test that due to what I just said
