## Main Arch Tasks 

| Menu Tasks                                                |   | Arch | Manjaro    |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|---|------|------------|

| Add Archive Support                                       |   | Pass | Not Tested |

- The Archive Support fail is likely due to me reorganizing the menu
