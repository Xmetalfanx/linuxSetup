March 2019, outline of how things should go 

Script runs 
1.) checks for lsb-release and if it is not installed, offer to install it
    - on Arch, Fedora,  OpenSuse, Solus, and Ubuntu bases
    - Put this in the documentation README.md file for "requirnments" 

2) noting that some people may select NOT to install lsb-release if they do not have it installed 
    - For this case the "cat /etc/os-release" fallback is needed 


What info I know from lsb_release?
    - Codename: 
        - mainly useful with ubuntu releases, detecting the version 
        - also if some codenames are detected ... say "bionic" here ... it can be safely assumed that you ARE ON an Ubuntu release 
    
    -Release: 
        - some distros like arch have "rolling" 
        - TW has the date of the snapshot you are on 
        - ubuntu has say "16.04" or "18.04"^

    -Description:
        - seems to be like a full label of the distro, release and maybe codename too 

    Dist ID: 
        - "Ubuntu" "arch" or "opensuse "... this should be a GREAT CHOICE for the primary check to see what distro it is 

#######
Idea: use lsbDescription for the main ID for detecting the distro with some "backup checks" just in case

os-release info/ideas 

if "UBUNTU_CODENAME=" exists (whatever it's value is), it's an Ubuntu based distro
