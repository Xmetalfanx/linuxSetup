## For OpenSuse

## Even if Cinnamon is not installed I THINK the Cinnamon repo has to be added ...

1.  Add Cinnamon Repo
    -  Note: you do not have to install Cinnamon

2.  Refresh Repo

3.  Now you have the option of installing Mint X-Apps and/or the Mint-y Theme and Icon Pack
  -  From my tests the icons are great on other distros
    -  Due to GTK updates, the theme seems broken on things with more updated versions of GTK.
    - You may want to do something like use the Arc theme (not the same colors but a similar theme) and then the Mint-Y Icon Pack
