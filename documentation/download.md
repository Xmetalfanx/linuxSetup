### Download from the Release Page

1. Go To [Xmetal's Linux Setup Script Release Page (there are links on the right as well)](https://github.com/Xmetalfanx/linuxSetup/releases/latest)
2. Download either the tar.gz or zip file and extract it
3. Enter the extracted directory

### Download with git

Please Note: this apparently gets a large amount of git history (my code changes) that is not needed really

Also the git package MAYBE preinstalled in some distros... I am assuming it's not with the instructions below

#### In Arch

`sudo pacman -S git`

#### In Fedora

`sudo dnf install git`

#### In OpenSUSE

`sudo zypper install git`

#### In Solus

`sudo eopkg install git`

#### In Ubuntu

`sudo apt install git`

- if that doesn't work `sudo apt-get install git`

## How to get the script via git method

In a Terminal run `git clone https://github.com/xmetalfanx/linuxscripts.git && cd linuxscripts`
