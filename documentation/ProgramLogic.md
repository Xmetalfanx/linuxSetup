# Start of Scripts

## I need to be able to: 

-   read lsb info 
    -   problem: some distros like Fedora and Arch do not have this by default... to install this I need to know the distro
    -   LOGICALLY this would mean that I need to use os-release info at this point ... but then if i say A) read os-releasae data, B) run checks .... what is the point getting lsb data after that? 
        -   I'd say that I'd need it later in the scripts 
-   read /etc/os-release
