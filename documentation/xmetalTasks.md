# Xmetal's Usual tasks

This is made for me ... instead of going through menus, the idea is to be able to do this and multple different things get done at once.

## 1 - Optimize Repos

-   _Fedora_: search for fastest mirror

-   _Manjaro Rank Mirrors_

-   Arch Linux  is supported too

## 2 - Update System

-   note: Updates packages ... doesn't do a dist upgrade type of task
    -   exception - OpenSuse Tumbleweed ... a "zypper dup" is done and NOT a "zypper up"

-   NOTE TO SELF: consider pausing here .... some updates need a system reboot first .... just ... consider this anyway

## 3 - Install third party repos

-   OpenSuse - Packman Repos (not to be confused with pacman from arch )
-   Fedora - RPM Fusion

## 4 - (if needed) Install Codecs

-   Mainly for say Fedora and OpenSuse, if I recall

## 5 - Install Software

### Installs software located in most distro bases

    massSoftwareInstall

### Extra software

    - vscode, XnViewMP, Tiny Media Manager, Etcher, MakeMKV
    - fish shell + Oh-My-Fish + some extras
    	- extras: bobthefish theme

### 6 - Install Theming

-   Theming (Themes/Icons/some cursors):
    	\- Arc, Adapta, Mint-Y, Numix, Plata, Yaru, Breeze (GTK)
    		\- there are Various Themes and Icons that vary from distro to distro, that are also installed.
    		\- not all of the listed themes may be installable in every distro version
