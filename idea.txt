new idea ... i need to grep for a pattern (what i have been pondering lately)... CAN i grep for a var name BUT in each software function pass what that var is? ... so in the gitDownload function the var name would be the same but since each repo has a different "naming scheme" .. THAT is PASSED into "gitDownload" from the software function 

- i can keep gitDownload "templified" 
- i can customize what is being searched for based on whaet i need for that repo
