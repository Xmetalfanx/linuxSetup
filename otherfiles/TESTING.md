## Test Results

- May 2022 - I can not say for sure how much the test results apply right now ... I probably should put a general set of dates on when each test was done

- Please note that I do not run all versions of all distros, so in some cases, (example) OpenSuse 15.0 Leap may say "fail" for that task, but OpenSuse Tumbleweed needed a fix, and now says "Pass" and I may have fixed the issue for Leap too ... but if i don't see it pass on an actual install (say Leap in my example there), I will leave what I saw with my own eyes, and that'd be a "fail" UNTIL I see it pass
