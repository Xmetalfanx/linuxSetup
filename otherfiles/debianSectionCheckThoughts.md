My Idea

Look for "main" and/or "main contrib nonfree" in the sources.list file (backing whatever the user has up first and not touching that after unless the user choice "restore original sources.list file" which i haven't coded yet ... )


I have to brush up on grep and sed (awk to maybe ... dont have much experience with awk)

problems i am seeing:
-   searching EXACTLY for "main" without "contrib nonfree"
-   sometimes (the way I typed it in manually?) it's not always "main contrib nonfree" but "contrib nonfree main" I have seen too
