What I need to know: 

1) Distro/Repo that this effects


What I want to happen: 
In the case of a program (VS say using a RPM or DEB file for example), I want the first thing to happen when this "case" is triggered, to have the new prompt function run ... 
    - if the user selects "no, i dont want to add this repo" I want (idea: to have an alternative way to install the program... say perhaps the DEB or RPM file option comes in here?)
    - if the user selects "yes" install repo: 
        ?? do the meta third party repo install ? '
        how would i handle say the "DEB Multimedia Debian repo" ... just call that as a separate function (vs "the metathird party" function, when needed?)
            - what would that function need to know?

idea- example 
<<<<<<< HEAD

thirdpartyRepo= name of repo (say RPMFusion or Packman, maybe)
    - this would be assigned in case statements where needed .... 
=======
thirdpartyRepo= name of repo (say RPMFusion or Packman, maybe s)
>>>>>>> bf12df6... start of prompt for third party repo, code
