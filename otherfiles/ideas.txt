Idea for  addition 

(Menu)
- Switch To Fastly CDN 
    -- Backup Current sources.list - consider the backup filename since i am doing an undo feature 
    -- changes the sources.list
- Switch back from Fastly CDN sources.list
    -- this undoes the step above of course
        --- maybe have say the filename sources.list.preCDNSwitch or something clearer at the end 
    -- if (in the CDN) contrib and non-free are available, just add them 
        --- if i find a way to do (without overcomplicating things) a "check for contrib and non-free" and "only add them if the user had them in the original sources.list" later 


Flatpak
    - (Seperate menu item in Universal Format Menu section ) Add Flathub
        -- OBVIOUSLY check for flatpak support first
