just to commit to something 

- The Detection function 
    - WILL NOT install anything ... that is handled elsewhere
    - converts (in a sense) the return status to a var ( packageInstalled="yes" or "no") 
    - passes that var back 
    - ? Where is this getting called? ... I need to know     



- the installApp function 
    - This will be the default for "default repo" (+ say RPMFusion once installed) apps/packages
