The idea is that all i have to do is "installApp <appname here> " (which reminds me I need to get that loop-idea working in bash ) and if the answer is yes across the board (in the table above) that is IT ... the installApp function handles it all no matter the distro

note to self: REMEMBER NOT to use Korora (w RPM fusion already installed) or Gecko (?? with packman repos already installed) as a test for OpenSuse and Fedora ... I want to test the "parent" distros here
