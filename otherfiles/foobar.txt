# this searches for the file to run the app
fullExecPath=$(find ~+ -type f -name "$programFileName" )

# based on $fullExecPath, this gets that dir 
programPath=$(basename $fullExecPath)

# this creates the line that will be pasted/appended to the menu file 
execPath=$(echo -e "Exec=$fullExecPath")

# The icon file (since some are svgs and some pngs i am thinking of assigning this in say the app's install function before things get passed to any "templified" functions)
iconPath=$(echo -e "Icon=$iconFile")


==============================================================
1 - Get menu file (locally in scripts) and icon file (locally) info (say the name)

2 - check to see if the menu file has existing "Exec=  "  and "IconFile= " code 
    - if yes, clear that out (note: there shouldn't be anyway)
    
 - Put the Exec= info into the menufile 
 - Put Icon= info into menu file
