1) Read in arch config file
2) See if aurHelper is set
    A) if it is set, display what is detected to the user
        - after displaying ask the user if they want to switch?
            - at least give the option to switch if both are installed?
    B)[FUNCTION- isAurHelperInstalled] if not set check if an AUR Helper is installed (maybe one is installed, but the script's var may just not be set)
        - in large part this is the code I had in the first place
