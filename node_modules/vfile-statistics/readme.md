Count [vfile][] messages per category (fatal, warn, info, nonfatal and total).

## Install

This package is [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c):
Node 12+ is needed to use it and it must be `import`ed instead of `require`d.

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install vfile-statistics
```

## Use

```js
import {VFile} from 'vfile'
import {statistics} from 'vfile-statistics'

var file = new VFile({path: '~/example.md'})

file.message('This could be better')
file.message('That could be better')

try {
  file.fail('This is terribly wrong')
} catch (err) {}

file.info('This is perfect')

console.log(statistics(file))
```

Yields:

```js
{fatal: 1, nonfatal: 3, warn: 2, info: 1, total: 4}
```

## API

There is no default export.

### `statistics(file)`

counts per category.

###### Returns
