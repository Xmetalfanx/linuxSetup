- right now i am not sure if i am adding wine-development back ... for now I don't want to overcomplicate things

- these are "in general" tests ... i am not testing all the ubuntu respins for example ... if something works in a distro based on 20.04 ... I will call that a pass for instance
- Leap 15.3 (at the time of me typing this)....even the Wine repos has NOTHING for Leap 15.3 (latest )
