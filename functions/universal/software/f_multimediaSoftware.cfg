  # Late March 2019 comment: I need to make it so, this function is as small as it can be ... as soon as it say detected the .tar.gz (or something like that), info is passed to other functions that take care of things ... 
  ## this is so i dont have redundent code in all ".tar.gz" archived 

  ## Keep code below ... this should be a test/idea bed for what will go into the template functions 




  # Setup temp location for download 
  mkdir ~/Documents/$programName
  cd ~/Documents/$programName 

  ## Pass to function to get infobased about the package URL and what to do
  
  
  ## download function that does things BASED on what extention the file is  


      # filenameWEXT needs to get to the next function but DO I need to pass anything? or is this var "just known" without a pass ?
      #extractDownload 
      





  clear
  ## try 2
  echo -e "Extracting " $programTitle "archive"
  #echo -e "Extracting $programTitle archive"
  mkdir $programName

  ## packageName idea ... this should be a var set inside of the function that gets the info about the url 
  tar -xvzf $packageName -C $programName
  clear
  echo -e "File $progName Extracted"
  userPrompt

  echo -e "Moving Tiny Media Directory to The home directory's Download folder"
  mv $programName/ ~/Documents

  # Cleanup

  ## Idea: I should put a check in here to make sure i am in the correct directory before I rm anything
  rm -rf tmm/
