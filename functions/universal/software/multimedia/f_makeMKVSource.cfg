## May be a bad idea but I am splitting this up to cleanup the MakeMKV file/code 
## This file is for compiling and installing from the tarball

# I shouldn't need to do this here but ... whatever
# question: can i move these vars to the f_variables.cfg file and skip this extra function?

function makeMKVFileInfo()
{
  # $1 = URL for current file being downloaded

  fileNameFULL=${1##*/}
  fileName=${fileNameFULL%.tar.gz}
