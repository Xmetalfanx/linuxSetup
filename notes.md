what will work with the github download page method with strawberry music player 

- both Fedora 41 and 42 filters ... # fedora_branch is like "41" or "42"
- Leap 15.6 is supported BUT i am pretty sure i need to refactored or looked at.
- Arch and Solus: appear to be in their default repos  
- Debian: Bookworm and Trixie (12 and 13 have their own DEBs)
- Ubuntu: Noble (24.04) and Pluxy (25.04) DEBs 
  - Jammy? (22.04) 1.13 is the last version for Jammy ... The PPA does support it OR (idea: look for the 1.13 release on github and hardcode that URL in maybe) 
    - https://github.com/strawberrymusicplayer/strawberry/releases/download/1.1.3/strawberry_1.1.3-jammy_amd64.deb
      - offer older version DEB, PPA or Flatpak
