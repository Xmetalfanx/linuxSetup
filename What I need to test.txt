What I need to test 

1) OcenAudio on all bases (maybe not Solus .. Arch is not coded yet so that will come last anyway)
    - openSUSE Leap - 
    - Fedora 36 - 
    - Debian - 
    - Ubuntu - 

2) Strawberry on Leap 15 (openSUSE) and Fedora (retest ... test 1 worked) - randomy on Leap 15.4 it did not work though .. have to troubleshoot this 
3) Strawberry on Debian
4) ??? Strawberry on Ubuntu or did i not touch the Ubuntu code for this? 

5) overall gdebi work HOWEVER I think that will sort itself out with tests 1 to 4.  (sort of a dual test)
6) overall RPM code work (same message as test 5, .. a dual test can be done)
