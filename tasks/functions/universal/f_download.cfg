function listInstall
{
  ## Basically how I'd use this is somewhere (menus just say), I'd call this function and all that needs to be passed is the name of the file in question.


  # $1 is telling it what list to use 
  # $downloadListDir is a preset location to where the files are 

  listFile=$downloadListDir/$1


  progNum=0
  while read -r listPrograms[progNum]; do
    ((progNum++))
  done < $listFile

  ## Sends the list to the universal Install scripts
  ## IF the user adds programs that need extra processing (say a repo added), this will not work on THAT distro.   my goal atm is to put programs that are common installs I always do and in default repos, here

  ## IF A USER knows of similar apps, they can add it to the file and remove any apps listed, they do NOT want.


  # Pass to Universal install function  
  installApps ${listPrograms[*]}
