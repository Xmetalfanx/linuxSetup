## Question to self: WHAT is the point of having "packageName" in these functions? ... shouldn't stripFileInfo find that info? ... is this var being here a leftover from the old pre-template way of doing things?

## Note to self: ... am i using "url" or "packageURL" for the final URL var? .. seems I am being inconsistant with that ... i know some DEBURL or RPMURL vars are used though 
  # packageURL does ... sound a little more verbose
