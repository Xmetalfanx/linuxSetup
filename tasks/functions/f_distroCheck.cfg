		## Idea: I am not sure if this will be too many functions, but perhaps in each if clause
		## put a link to the functions to get more specific results using "PRETTY_NAME"
		## THAT WAY I could narrow it down the distro to say "Leap 42.1 vs Leap 42.2" ..
		## I could in that example make one PacmanRepo Function and based on the info in PRETTY_NAME..
		## only the URL would change vs having different lines for each version of SUSE that are
		## BASICALLY the same exact line.

    ## Here CheckDistro is run already, in if statement conditions in that function
    ## stripName is called and in these functions (this one) I need to use "$noPeriodName"

    # What I hope to get info wise is "trusty" vs "xenial" versus (?) 16.10

    # The POINT is with that I can make a single line to add X Y or Z and based on the output of this function
    # just things will change

    # The IDEA is that that instead of having different lines for all three releases ... just have one line and the
    # variable or URL will change based on this output (of this function)... SHOULD be simplier in the long run
