<p>Idea: WHY have the arc install item in each section with seperate functions? ... I should make ONE function that takes care of things no matter the distro and in each Distro Section .... link to that single function </p>
<p> All Tasks means most of the above tasks just done all at once and not forcing the user to click one by one by one.  IMPORTANT ... put a prompt to the user at the start with "are you SURE you want to do this?"</p>
