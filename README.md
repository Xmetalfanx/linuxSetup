# Xmetal's Linux Scripts

*IF you see any github scripts in my script, that I forgot to disable, please do not use them... they  are not all broken, though the themes themselves do not seem to look correct/as intended... I will fix that later*

## Introduction

A problem SOME users, even if they are experienced have when setting up some distributions, is all the post install tasks they have to do to setup a "workable" system.   The tasks may not be difficult to do, but just rather they are time consuming.  These scripts can hopefully give people a "helping hand" getting different distro bases set up.

While The main distributions listed are meant to be "Distro family bases", not ALL scripts are practically on all distros.   For example a few of the "Fedora scripts" are already pre-done for you, if you use Korora.  

## How this project came to be
1.  First this was going to be a more basic, and all automated way of me setting up my system.
2.  I then decided that this could be useful for anyone and decided to (eventually) make two branches ... one for me which is more customized for me and another branch which is more generic but anyone could use
3.  By doing this project, I can not only help others, but also learn more bash AND git / github

## Thanks
- Too many to list them all
-  While I was likely to do this anyway, it is people like [Midfngr](https://www.youtube.com/user/midfingr/undefined) that inspire me to help other, though this entire idea started with no menus, and just a way for ME TO AUTOMATE some post distro install tasks, the idea this could help others is why it has grown so much
- Thanks to [Matthew Moore](https://www.youtube.com/user/MrGizmo757/undefined) for much of the Arch info in his Arch install notes.

## Goals
1.  To have scripts I can run on various distros that automate many of the post install "out of the box" tasks that I always perform anyway.
    - Distro families to be included are
      - Ubuntu
      - OpenSuse
      - Arch
      - Fedora
      
2. When I have things done, there may be a branch for me and a more generic branch for others to use ... the generic branch would not have all the specific addition software sources, or it may not install all the same apps, though it will get many users "on their feet" after a base install
