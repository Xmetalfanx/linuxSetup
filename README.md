# Xmetal's Linux Scripts


## Introduction

A problem SOME users, even if they are experienced have when setting up some distributions, is all the post install tasks they have to do to setup a "workable" system.   The tasks may not be difficult to do, but just rather they are time consuming.  These scripts can hopefully give people a "helping hand" getting different distro bases set up.

While The main distributions listed are meant to be "Distro family bases", not ALL scripts are practically on all distros.   For example a few of the "Fedora scripts" are already pre-done for you, if you use Korora.  

## Disclaimer
-  Standard Disclaimer about how I am not responsible about what scripts you run on your own computer or what mistakes may occur

## Thanks
- Too many to list them all
- While I was likely to do this anyway, it is people like [Midfngr](https://www.youtube.com/user/midfingr/undefined) that inspire me to help other, though this entire idea started with no menus, and just a way for ME TO AUTOMATE some post distro install tasks, the idea this could help others is why it has grown so much
- Thanks to [Matthew Moore](https://www.youtube.com/user/MrGizmo757/undefined) for much of the Arch info in his Arch install notes.

## Goals
1.  To have scripts I can run on various distros that automate many of the post install "out of the box" tasks that I always perform anyway.
    - Distro families to be included are
      - Ubuntu
      - OpenSuse
      - Arch
      - Fedora
